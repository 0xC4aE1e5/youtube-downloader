# youtube-downloader

A GUI frontend for yt-dlp in PowerShell.

## How to run
Just do the normal right click `Run With PowerShell`. The app might take a while to open on first launch, however.

## How to save as audio
In the location prompt, you can choose the type. There is a catch, however: The audio file is a `.m4a`.
### What is an M4A?
A `.m4a` file is like a `.mp3` file, but M4As are better in quality and bigger files. If you need to, you can use an online converter website (such as http://cloudconvert.com).
